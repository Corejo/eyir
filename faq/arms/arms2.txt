**Q:** Do I wait for 40 rage to cast Execute?
**A:** No, you want to use execute at any rage, the DPR scales linearly.

__THIS CAN VARY FROM CHARACTER TO CHARACTER PLEASE SIM FOR MORE ACCURATE WEIGHTS__

**Q:** What Gems/Enchants do I use?
**A:** Gale-Force Striking on weapon, Haste gems and enchants on ring.

**Q:** Are there any breakpoints we need to aim for?
**A:** No, there are tons of breakpoints that are not impactful outside of a sim. 

**Q:** What talents/traits should I take for M+?
**A:** 

If you're using Cleave. The talent set up is Skullsplitter, Storm Bolt, Fervor of Battle, Defensive Stance, Cleave, In for the Kill and Anger Management. With Test of Might for Azerite traits and Mastery/Haste focused for stats. In higher keys mobs tend to live longer and some pulls are bigger, which gives more potential for Cleave and Test of Might to pump out some serious AoE damage while still having decent single target.

For the Warbreaker build, you'd choose Massacre and Warbreaker. Paired with Lord of War and Gathering Storm traits. With focus on Crit/Vers for stats. This build excels in burst AoE but lacks single target.

__Both builds are equally viable in M+, it largely depends on how your group pulls and the composition of said group.__

**Q:** What Potions does Arms use?
**A:** 
Single Target: Unbridled Fury on pull with no lust. Focused Resolve if lusting on pull and ALWAYS in Lucid+Execute Window
2-3 Target Cleave: Greater Strength
4+ Target AoE: Proximity 

**Q:** What are the best Trinkets for Arms?
